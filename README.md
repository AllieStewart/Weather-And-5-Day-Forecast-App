# Weather_And_5-Day_Forecast-App

## Description
Challenge 6 coursework for UT bootcamp. <br />
This challenge is about creating a webpage that connects to the <br />
https://openweathermap.org/api when the name of a city is input into the search query. <br />
It gives the current weather in the city searched, as well as the temperature, wind, and humidity. <br />
It also gives a 5-day forecast of upcoming weather in the city, using the <br />
same API, with the same attributes. <br />

---Unfortunately, appends more cities for current weather + 5-day forecast when another search is done--- <br />

## What I Have Learned
I have learned a lot about local storage and how to utilize it to append a search history, as well <br />
as how APIs work in allowing the webpage to access data it otherwise would never be able to retrieve. <br />
