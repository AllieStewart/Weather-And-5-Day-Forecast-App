# Challenge-6

## Description
Challenge 6 coursework for UT bootcamp. This challenge is about creating
a webpage that connects to the https://openweathermap.org/api when the name
of a city is input into the search query. It gives the current weather in
the city searched, as well as the temperature, wind, and humidity.
It also gives a 5-day forecast of upcoming weather in the city, using the
same API, with the same attributes.
